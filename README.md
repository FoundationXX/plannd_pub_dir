# plannd_pub_dir

This website is fully functional.
The front end was based on some template my teammates had started on before I joined.
In this rep, it lists some front end files that introduces our project, team members, etc

On our live website, it utilizes our mailchimp & shopify account (http://www.plannd.it/)

Please have a look at the bottom of home.html file for some javascript code I worked on.
